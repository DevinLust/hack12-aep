In this project we trained a model to predict high value comments
from AEP's field workers. We combined relevant statistics into
a dashboard to find out which incidents might need to be focused
on more closely and taken more seriously. Here you will find a
jupyter notebook which we used to cluster and train the model.
We have taken careful steps to ensure that no comments are
posted anywhere in this repo. We also have an image of the 
dashboard we created.
